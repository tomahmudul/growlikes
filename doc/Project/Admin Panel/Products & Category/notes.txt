Can use the same layout as products on Funtime.

Make it more neater.

So we can filter them from a drop down or something? Where the red is http://prntscr.com/didolt
So on growlikes we can choose say Facebook Fan Page Likes and it will show all the FB likes there

When we change something here it will change it on the website.

We don't need "Product Image" or "Product Qty" the product Code should be assigned auto
